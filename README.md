# DragonExplore
Dragon flying prototype I made a few years ago

NOT intended for commercial use. I may come back to this project eventually, so don't use this code in your own game and pass it off as your own. (And trust me a lot of this code kinda sucks, so you probably shouldn't even want to)

Some code files (identified in the project) in this project are Copyright (c) 2008-2020, Rune Skovbo Johansen.
